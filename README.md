# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Well... more or less [tamagokun's dotfiles](https://github.com/tamagokun/dotfiles) that were cloned and then modified to suit my own development need (thaaaaaanks!)

# Setting up a new Mac

- Install Xcode from App Store
- `xcode-select --install`
- `git clone https://github.com/asanger/dotfiles.git`
- `cd dotfiles && ./mac`

Run `~/dotfiles/mac` at any time to keep packages up to date.
